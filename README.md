# Deep Learning regression and classification neural networks using Keras
I already knew how to do regression and classification via sciki-learn. But how about Deep_Learning? I have experience using Keras to bulid CNN for images. Now, I will explore using Keras to build regression and classification models to solve numerical problems (not images). Let's do this.
